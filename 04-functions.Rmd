# Functions {#functions}
I came very late to functions, and I wish I had learned them earlier. 




## The Basic Function

A function is a handy way to bundle together some lines of code. DRob says that if you run a few lines more than twice you should write a function for it which is quite a good idea . . . 

Let's create a function to make R welcome us. 

```{r}
mynameis <- function (name) {
  print (paste0("Hello, ", name, ", how are you today?"))
}

mynameis ("Jill")
```
