# RConversations
There are many ways to teach R - and yet we still seem to struggle to get students to adopt it enthusiastically. I'm no brilliant coder, but I am a half-decent teacher. I want to create a set of teaching resources that can be used and improved upon by others. If nothing else, I'll get better at R myself!
