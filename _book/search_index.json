Mainly because it seemed like not teaching it was short-changing my students. As with all things, the more I wrote, the more confident I became. More than anything else I’m a writer. I only ever understand something once I’ve put it down on a page. So this book is a combination of wanting to understand R, to understand R teaching, to understand Bookdown, and to maybe help someone else along the way. My philosophy is always to use what works. 1.1.1 The Philosophy Do not read this book cover to cover It will not help. Instead, treat this book like a reference manual. Search it. Annotate it. Create a pull request to edit it or request a new section. Jump from one end of the book to the next and despair at You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 1. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2018) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). References "],

There are some great power users of R who are able to pull R code out of nowhere. The rest of us look it up, copy and paste, and modify. That is perfectly normal and acceptable behaviour. 2.2 Installing R and R Studio Part of my big revelation that copying and pasting code was okay was getting to use R Studio, which is a great program to help you use R. I strongly suggest you install R Studio alongside R. It’s free! 2.2.1 Accompany Video If you prefer to get your resources in video format, there’s an explanation of installing R and R Studio here 2.2.2 Installing R Step one is to head on over to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (or cran) 2.2.3 Installing R Studio "],

DRob says that if you run a few lines more than twice you should write a function for it which is quite a good idea . . . Let’s create a function to make R welcome us. mynameis &lt;- function (name) { print (paste0(&quot;Hello, &quot;, name, &quot;, how are you today?&quot;)) } mynameis (&quot;Jill&quot;) ## [1] &quot;Hello, Jill, how are you today?&quot; "],
